# Dice-Roller
This projects goal is to accuratly simulate dice of many different 3D shapes being thrown and bouncing on the ground. I started the project as a way to practice using a graphics library (specifically OpenGl through python) on a project I would enjoy. For the most part it has served that purpose and will mostly only be updated when I find the time to work on it further.

Currently the code is able to simulate all of the platonic solids bouncing on a floor. There are a few small bugs that show up every once in awhile, but for the most part it does a fine job creating a wireframe image that is convincingly accurate.
